prompt_text: "I need to create a detailed specification for Phase I: Todo In-Memory Python Console App. **Context:** This is Phase I of the Todo Hackathon. I need to implement all 5 Basic Level features using an in-memory Python console application. **Reference the Constitution:** @speckit.constitution **Required Features (Basic Level):** 1. Add Task – Create new todo items 2. Delete Task – Remove tasks from the list 3. Update Task – Modify existing task details 4. View Task List – Display all tasks 5. Mark as Complete – Toggle task completion status **Specification Requirements:** Create a `speckit.specify` file with the following sections: ### 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW - Purpose of the application - Target user (individual tracking their tasks) - Current phase context (Phase I of 5) - Success criteria for Phase I ### 2. USER JOURNEYS For each of the 5 basic features, define: - **Journey Name** - **Actor**: Console user - **Preconditions**: What state the app must be in - **Steps**: Detailed user interaction flow - **Postconditions**: Expected state after completion - **Alternative Paths**: Error cases and edge cases Example structure for \"Add Task\": - User launches application - User selects \"Add Task\" from menu - System prompts for task title - User enters title - System prompts for description (optional) - User enters description or skips - System confirms task creation with assigned ID - System returns to main menu ### 3. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS **FR-1: Task Management** - FR-1.1: System must allow creating tasks with title (required) and description (optional) - FR-1.2: System must assign unique integer IDs to each task automatically - FR-1.3: System must store tasks in memory during runtime - FR-1.4: System must support viewing all tasks with their details - FR-1.5: System must allow updating task title and description - FR-1.6: System must allow deleting tasks by ID - FR-1.7: System must allow marking tasks as complete/incomplete **FR-2: User Interface** - FR-2.1: System must provide a text-based menu with numbered options - FR-2.2: System must validate all user inputs - FR-2.3: System must display clear prompts and confirmation messages - FR-2.4: System must show appropriate error messages for invalid operations - FR-2.5: System must allow exiting the application gracefully **FR-3: Data Display** - FR-3.1: Task list must show: ID, Title, Status (Complete/Incomplete) - FR-3.2: System must indicate when no tasks exist - FR-3.3: System must display task details clearly formatted ### 4. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA **AC-1: Add Task** - Given user selects \"Add Task\" - When user enters valid title (1-200 characters) - And optionally enters description (max 1000 characters) - Then system creates task with unique ID - And system displays confirmation with task ID - And task appears in task list **AC-2: View Task List** - Given tasks exist in the system - When user selects \"View Tasks\" - Then system displays all tasks with ID, title, and status - And tasks are numbered/ordered - And completion status is clearly indicated **AC-3: Update Task** - Given task exists with ID - When user selects \"Update Task\" and provides valid ID - And user provides new title and/or description - Then system updates the task - And system displays confirmation **AC-4: Delete Task** - Given task exists with ID - When user selects \"Delete Task\" and provides valid ID - Then system removes task from list - And system displays confirmation - And task no longer appears in list **AC-5: Mark Complete** - Given task exists with ID - When user selects \"Mark Complete\" and provides valid ID - Then system toggles completion status - And system displays current status - And status is reflected in task list ### 5. DATA MODEL **Task Entity:** ```python { \"id\": int, # Unique identifier (auto-increment) \"title\": str, # 1-200 characters, required \"description\": str, # 0-1000 characters, optional \"completed\": bool, # Default: False \"created_at\": datetime, # Auto-generated \"updated_at\": datetime # Auto-updated } ``` ### 6. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS - NFR-1: Application must start in under 1 second - NFR-2: All operations must respond immediately (< 100ms) - NFR-3: Application must handle invalid inputs gracefully - NFR-4: Code must be maintainable for Phase II migration - NFR-5: Memory usage must be reasonable (< 100MB for 1000 tasks) ### 7. CONSTRAINTS - Must use in-memory storage only (Python list/dict) - No external libraries except Python standard library - No persistence between application runs - Console-only interface (no GUI) - Single-user application ### 8. OUT OF SCOPE (Phase I) - User authentication - Data persistence - Multiple users - Task priorities, tags, or categories - Due dates and reminders - Search and filter functionality - Recurring tasks - Web interface Please create a comprehensive specification following this structure."
response_text: "Successfully created a comprehensive specification for the Todo Console App at specs/001-todo-console-app/spec.md. The specification includes: 1. Project Overview 2. User Journeys for all 5 required features 3. Functional Requirements 4. Acceptance Criteria 5. Data Model 6. Non-Functional Requirements 7. Constraints 8. Out of Scope items Additionally, created a quality checklist at specs/001-todo-console-app/checklists/requirements.md to validate the specification completeness and quality. The specification follows all required sections and meets the quality criteria."
outcome: 'Successfully created a comprehensive specification for the Todo Console App with all required sections and a quality checklist.'
evaluation: 'The specification includes all required sections: project overview, user journeys for all 5 features, functional requirements, acceptance criteria, data model, non-functional requirements, constraints, and out of scope items. The quality checklist confirms all requirements have been met and the specification is ready for the next phase.'
